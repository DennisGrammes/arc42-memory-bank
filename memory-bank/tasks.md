# CURRENT TASK: C4 Model to arc42 Architecture Migration

## Task Overview
**Objective**: Replace all references to C4 model with arc42 architecture documentation approach throughout the .github folder files.

**Complexity Level**: Level 3-4 (Complex System Task)
- Multiple files need modification
- Architecture documentation standards change
- System-wide consistency required
- May require multiple iterations due to context limitations

## Task Context
- **Current State**: .github folder contains architecture guidance using C4 model
- **Target State**: All architecture references should use arc42 template
- **Scope**: All files in .github directory and subdirectories
- **Risk**: May lose context during task execution, requiring resumption

## Files to Analyze and Modify
*This section will be updated as analysis progresses*

## Files to Analyze and Modify
*Analysis Complete - Files Identified*

### 1. Core System Scheme Files âœ…
- `c1.prompt.md` - System scheme (C1) generation
- `c2.prompt.md` - Component scheme (C2) generation  
- `system-scheme-management.md` - System scheme guidelines

### 2. Architecture Documentation Files âœ…
- `architectural-planning.md` - Level 4 architectural planning
- `creative-phase-architecture.md` - Architecture design workflow
- `copilot-instructions.md` - References to C1/C2 schemes

### 3. Workflow Files with Architecture References âœ…
- `van.prompt.md` - System scheme path requirements
- `plan.prompt.md` - Architecture considerations
- `creative.prompt.md` - Architecture design process
- `implement.prompt.md` - System scheme references
- `qa.prompt.md` - System scheme validation

### 4. Analysis Phase âœ…
- [x] Search for all C4 model references in .github folder
- [x] Identify files that mention architecture documentation  
- [x] Catalog specific locations and context of C1/C2 references
- [x] Determine arc42 equivalent concepts for each reference

### 5. Modification Phase âœ… COMPLETE
- [x] Update system-scheme-management.md with arc42 approach
- [x] Create context.prompt.md and blocks.prompt.md (replacing C1/C2)
- [x] Update copilot-instructions.md references
- [x] Modify workflow files to reference arc42 sections
- [x] Revise architectural-planning.md with arc42 structure
- [x] Update visual maps terminology
- [x] Update Level 2/3/4 workflow references
- [x] Remove old C1/C2 prompt files

### 6. Verification Phase âœ… COMPLETE  
- [x] Review all modified files for consistency
- [x] Ensure arc42 concepts are correctly applied
- [x] Test file links/references still work
- [x] Final consistency check
- [x] Update README.md with arc42 references
- [x] Update task-tracking-advanced.md component visualizations
- [x] Verify creative-phase files (confirmed C1/C2 are diagram labels only)
- [x] Complete migration summary created

## ðŸŽ‰ TASK COMPLETE

**Final Status**: âœ… **MIGRATION SUCCESSFUL**

All C4 model references have been successfully replaced with arc42 architecture documentation approach. The system now uses industry-standard arc42 template structure while maintaining full workflow functionality.

**Key Achievements**:
- 17 files total modified/created/removed
- 15 files modified with arc42 terminology  
- 2 new /context and /blocks commands created
- Full arc42 template integration
- Zero breaking changes to existing workflows

See `MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md` for detailed summary.

## Progress Log
**Started**: 2025-06-30 - Task documented and analysis phase initiated

## Key Findings
**C1/C2 System Schemes** - Current system uses C1/C2 terminology (likely from C4 model)
- C1: System as black box with external systems (C4 Context level)
- C2: Internal service components (C4 Container level)

## Key Concepts Mapping
**Current System â†’ arc42 Equivalent**
- C1 System Scheme â†’ arc42 Section 3 (System Scope and Context)
- C2 Component Scheme â†’ arc42 Section 5 (Building Block View Level 1)
- System Context Diagram â†’ arc42 Business/Technical Context
- Component Architecture Diagram â†’ arc42 Building Block Decomposition
- Architecture Documentation â†’ arc42 Full Template Structure

## Next Steps
1. Search for C4 model references across .github folder
2. Document findings and create modification plan
3. Begin systematic replacement
4. Update this task file with progress

## Context Preservation Notes
- This task may require multiple sessions due to context limits
- All progress will be documented in this file
- Key findings and mappings will be preserved here
- Resumption instructions will be maintained
