# CREATIVE Mode and the Think Methodology

This document outlines how the CREATIVE phase applies a structured think-based approach to exploring design options and documenting decisions.

## Conceptual Parallels

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Think-Based Approach"
        T1["1: Decompose Problem"] --> T2["2: Explore Solutions"]
        T2 --> T3["3: Analyze Trade-offs"]
        T3 --> T4["4: Select & Document Decision"]
        T4 --> T5["5: Validate Decision"]
    end
```

The CREATIVE mode mirrors this workflow by breaking down complex components, evaluating alternatives, recording reasoning, and validating choices before implementation.
